# 🧠 Insurance Churn Analysis Project

## Overview  
This project explores customer churn behavior in the insurance sector using Python-based data analysis and machine learning. It demonstrates how data-driven insights can support retention strategies, improve claim approval predictions, and guide business decisions.

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Analyze churn patterns across customer segments and policy types  
- Predict claim approval using supervised learning  
- Identify key drivers of churn and approval decisions  
- Deliver actionable insights through visualizations and feature importance analysis

## 📂 Inputs
- **Data Set**: insurance_churn.csv

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Data processing, modeling  
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data wrangling  
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib**: Exploratory visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn**: Feature scaling, model training, evaluation  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Predictive modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Converted categorical variables to appropriate types  
   - Applied one-hot encoding and feature scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized churn distribution and loyalty score impact  
   - Analyzed churn by policy type and customer segment  

3. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
   - Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict claim approval  
   - Achieved **82% accuracy**, with strong precision and recall  
   - Evaluated model using classification report and confusion matrix  

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - Identified top drivers: **Loyalty Score**, **Income**, **Policy Tenure**, and **Customer Satisfaction Score**  
   - Visualized top 10 features influencing claim approval

## 📈 Results
